![Christian Krudewig]({{ '/assets/images/profile.png' | relative_url }})

Welcome to my personal blog!

The purpose of this space is to let you participate in all the new things and methods I come across on my journey through the world of software engineering.
You will find articles about Python, C++, Go, Kubernetes, home automation and many more things.


## About me
My name is Christian Krudewig and I work as machine learning architect for a big German company.

My day-to-day business is about designing, implementing and reshaping machine learning solutions from the software engineering perspective. 
Originally I studied economics and spend some more time at universities teaching and researching in the area of operations management. Afterwards I worked as an IT project manager at first, then as a data scientist for some time, before I found my current architect role. The connection between all these activities has always been my love to programming and the fascination for solving real-live problems with mere software. 

Back at university I learned to analyze data and forecast behaviour of markets or tax subjects. During my research I could see how one can solve problems far beyond human solvability with clever algorihms. As a project manager I could contribute to making life much easier for store managers of a big retail company through automated shelf replenishment. And finally, in my current job I immersed into the creation of more and more complex machine learning applications using all the cool tools, languages and cloud environments that we have at hand currently. 

What puzzles me sometimes is that we are now routinely using "established" technologies which just hadn't been there when I finished my studies - and that was in 2009 which doesn't feel that far away for me. Some examples for this are Elasticsearch ([first release 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)), the Go language ([first appeared 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))), Kubernetes ([inital release 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)), scikit-learn([first public release 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn)). I could continue forever with more useful tools, languages, databases and libraries that were introduced in the last ten years, mostly as open source software. I enjoy very much being in the middle of this development and seeing it all come to action.
