Christian Krudewig -- principal MLOps engineer and software architect at DHL Data & AI.

On my personal blog, you can find thoughts and discoveries on all things related to software engineering.
My primary areas of interest include Python, Rust, machine learning, Kubernetes, Go, and home automation. 
Therefore, my blog posts focus on these topics and I share some of my learnings in the hope that it may save others some work.

## About me

| "Build with curiosity, then simplify, automate and start over."

I studied economics at university and subsequently worked as an IT project manager, data scientist and software architect. 
Now, I'm MLOps tech lead at DHL Data & AI.

My work primarily involves building, running and improving machine learning solutions from a software engineering perspective. 
I also spent time teaching and researching operations management at the university. 
Throughout my career, my passion for programming and my fascination with using software to solve real-world problems have been the common threads connecting all of these activities.

When I started with computers, I had to teach them how to even start up properly. Now, we're working with a high degree of automation and use computers which tell us how to best configure other computers. With LLMs and AI agents, we've reached a point where machines can reason and make decisions autonomously. What an amazing ride, especially in the last 15 years, when machine learning and Python picked up speed.

Many "established" technologies we now routinely employ didn't even exist when I finished my studies in 2009. The Rust language ([first stable release 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))), Elasticsearch (first release 2010), Kubernetes ([initial release 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)), and scikit-learn ([first public release 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn)) are just a few examples. There are many other useful tools, languages, databases and libraries that have been introduced in the last decade, mostly as open-source software. 

It is a privilege to be at the forefront of this technological progress and witness it in action.
