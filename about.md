![Christian Krudewig]({{ '/assets/images/profile.png' | relative_url }})

Welcome to my personal blog!

The purpose of this space is to let you participate in all the new things and methods I come across on my journey through the world of software engineering.
You will find articles about Python, C++, Go, Kubernetes, home automation and many more things.


## About me

My name is Christian Krudewig.
I studied economics, did research in the area of operations management, worked as an IT project manager, data scientist, and now as a machine learning architect.
The connection between all these activities has always been my love to programming and the fascination of solving real-live problems with computers. Back at university I learned to analyze data and forecast behaviour of markets or tax subjects. During my research I could see how one can solve problems far beyond human solvability with clever algorihms. As a project manager I could contribute to making the live easier much easier for store managers of a big retail company through automated replenishment of stocks. And finally in my current job I immersed into the creation of more and more complex machine learning applications routinely using technologies which just haven't been there when I finished my studies in 2009 - sometimes I can hardly believe how swiftly technology evolves.
