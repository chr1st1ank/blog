Greetings, I'm Christian Krudewig, lead MLOps engineer and software architect at Deutsche Post DHL.

On my personal blog, you can find thoughts and discoveries on all things related to software engineering.
My primary areas of interest include Python, Rust, machine learning, Kubernetes, Go, and home automation. Therefore, my blog posts focus on these topics and I share some of my learnings in the hope that it may save others some work.

## About me

I studied economics at university and subsequently worked as an IT project manager, data scientist and software architect. Now, I'm MLOps tech lead in my department.

My work primarily involves designing, implementing, and improving machine learning solutions from a software engineering perspective. Although I originally studied economics, I also spent time teaching and researching operations management at the university. Before assuming my MLOps tech lead role, I worked as a software architect, IT project manager and data scientist. Throughout my career, my passion for programming and my fascination with using software to solve real-world problems have been the common threads connecting all of these activities.

It's sometimes amazing that we now routinely employ "established" technologies that didn't even exist when I finished my studies in 2009 - not so long ago, in my opinion. The Rust language ([first stable release 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))), Elasticsearch (first release 2010), Kubernetes ([inital release 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)), scikit-learn([first public release 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn)) are a few examples. There are many other useful tools, languages, databases and libraries that have been introduced in the last decade, mostly as open-source software. It is a privilege to be at the forefront of this technological progress and witness it in action.
