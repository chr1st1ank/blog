title:  "Hosting a Blog the GitOps Way"
description: How to set up a blog which is entirely driven and controlled by git. No database, no manual deployments, no manual updates.
---
**Thanks to static site generators a blog can easily be driven and controlled by markdown files in a git repository. This way it is not necessary to set up a content management system including a database ever worrying to end up hosting yet another hacked Wordpress instance. Instead one can focus on the content and publish by simply pushing to the main branch.**

In the last couple of years I have been testing many new tools or, packages. Some turned out to be not really beneficial for the purpose I had in mind. But others found a permanent place in my toolbox. I used them more often, recommended them to colleagues and in some cases even created a tutorial or provided a training. Then at some point I realized that such things are worth sharing with a wider community than just the people working behind locked doors of my company. So there must be a blog.

But how does one manage a blog these days? I've been experimenting with wordpress and at least one other PHP based content management system years ago. At the time these were good tools. When I did some research for available blog engines or content management systems (CMS), I found out that the seasoned veterans like Wordpress or Drupal are still there. They need a webspace with PHP and a database, of course. Installation means copying the source code. Updating means overwriting the source code in place. This works. I have done it before. Others do it regularly. But I also recall a lot of pain with unsuccessfull updates of similar systems, e.g. Nextcloud. And not updating is not an option because the big CMS systems are well-known for being the target (see e.g. [here](https://www.imperva.com/blog/cms-security-tips/) or [here](https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/why-malicious-hacker-target-wordpress/)). There are more modern systems, e.g. the nodejs application Ghost. I think this is a really good choice. However it is not so different from the "admin" perspective. It is still a stateful service that needs to be managed. And actually in the recent years I have learned that it is well possible to have the full configuration of any service under version control in a github repository and separate it cleanly from the data. That was what I wanted. And actually I had in mind writing the blog posts in Markdown, so also this could be put under version control and there would basically no data be left. So what for do I need a database then?

Inspired by a colleague who suggested to "simply put some markdown files on github" I remembered that there is "github-pages", a feature of github which allows to publish certain content on static websites. We use that often at work to host the documentation rendered from source code. I did some more research on the web and hit a [blog post by Ciaran O'Donnel](https://ciaranodonnell.dev/posts/switching-to-github-io/#what-blog-engines-have-i-tried) which describes very detailed Ciaran's process of choosing a blog engine and how he ended up using github's built-in capabilites. I decided to give it a try.

## Static site generators
So, what is a static site generator? A classical dynamic web page generates the website on client request. It compiles static pieces like for example HTML templates, server-side includes and database fields as well as dynamic snippets generated by a scripting language such as PHP into the final web page which is delivered to the webbrowser. In contrast, a static site generator does this already ahead of time. It introduces an additional build step as part of the deployment process and pre-generates all possible views of the web page, so that the web server only has to deliver static content.

I can remember static site generators from my first experiences with website creation in the late ninetees and early 2000s. Back then HTML editors like Frontpage and Dreamweaver were an alternative to writing HTML by hand. They promised a what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience. I found them rather unwieldy, they never did exactly what I wanted. Instead of getting "what I saw", the generated HTML markup often contained a lot of autogenerated garbage that often looked completely different from browser to browser. But the main drawback with static sites in general was, that it wasn't possible at first to have dynamic components in it. For example if you needed a login, or an e-mail or guestbook form, it has always been necessary to have some server side code running anyways. Therefore I soon switched to handcrafting the HTML and using something like PHP to render all pages into the same templates.

With the increasing use of RESTfull webservices together with more and more powerful client-side scripting, the main disadvantage of static pages has become meaningless for content sites. Of course for complex web applications like web shops, server side scripting is probably still the way to go. But for pages which mainly deliver static content like text and images with some dynamic add-ons it really isn't necessary any longer to generate pages dynamically. One can load all the dynamic parts via Javascript from dedicates services, so that a static HTML page with a little bit of embedded Javascript does the job very well.

So a newer kind of static site generators has evolved, addressing the needs of developers better than the classic tools. Some examples of this are [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) or [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). With these one can prepare the templates as plain HTML/CSS/Javascript files while the content is typically written as plain text files in Markdown. This allows to keep the content completely under version control, similar to source code. When the text is written, the site generator compiles the markdown files into HTML and you only need a static webserver to deliver the content. No database is needed and no security issues with server-side scripting languages can occur.

## Setting up a blog with Github-pages and Jekyll
Github offers the option to serve static websites via the built-in service "github-pages". If you have a github repository you can configure github-pages to create a web page from the contents of a certain folder or git branch. Per default the static site generator jekyll is used to render the contents. This setup already offers enough functionality for something simple as a blog.

To start a github account and some repository on it are needed. 

### Initial steps
- github account
- repository
- Set up local ruby environment
#### Setting up jekyll for local previews

Jekyll is a ruby package. So you need a ruby environment with the necessary dependencies to generate the blog as html page. Take a look at the [jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/) for a detailed guide on how to set things up. To set up a fresh working environment for this blog only the following commands are necessary (this is for arch linux):

```bash
# Install ruby
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel ruby ruby-bundler
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chr1st1ank/blog.git
cd clone
# Install the dependencies from the Gemfile:
bundle install
```

The last command installs all the ruby dependencies ("gems") from the Gemfile. This step may take a while because the dependencies are compiled from source code.

### Configure the blog
- repository layout
- configs
- themes
- additional features (comments, tags, categories, ...)
    - tags (clickable)
    - code snippets
    - comments via staticman

## Publishing the git-ops way
- general process: push to main -> webpage
- updates, database backups
  - right, none of these are necessary. 
  - The configuration is code. The content is code.
- drafts
- working remotely
- In theory: colaborating and reviewing


## Some subheading

At some point, you’ll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like assets, into which any images, files or other resources are placed. Then, from within any post, they can be linked to using the site’s root as the path for the asset to include. The best way to do this depends on the way your site’s (sub)domain and path are configured, but here are some simple examples in Markdown:

Including an image asset in a post:
{% raw %}
```html
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```
{% endraw %}
